## Name of Project Idea - Traffic Signs Recognition
**Problem Statement:**

In the world of Artificial Intelligence and advancement in 
technologies, many researchers and big companies like Tesla, 
Uber, Google, Mercedes-Benz, Toyota, Ford, Audi, etc are working 
on autonomous vehicles and self-driving cars. 
So, for achieving accuracy in this technology, the vehicles should 
be able to interpret traffic signs and make decisions accordingly.
Traffic signs are an essential part of our day to day lives. They 
contain critical information that ensures the safety of all the people 
around us. Without traffic signs, all the drivers would be clueless 
about what might be ahead to them and roads can become a mess. 
The annual global road crash statistics say that over 3,280 people 
die every day in a road accident. These numbers would be much 
higher in case if there were no traffic signs.

**Solution:**

Our approach to building this traffic sign classification model is discussed in four steps:
• Explore the dataset
• Build a CNN model
• Train and validate the model
• Test the model with test dataset
So, to fix all this issues, we want to create an web application and with the help of this we can avoid road 
accidents.
We will build a deep neural network model that can classify traffic signs present in the image into different 
categories. With this model, we are able to read and understand traffic signs which are a very important task for all 
autonomous vehicles.
As the technology becomes more widespread its capabilities will increase too, so it would be natural for the signs 
a car can identify to increase. There are also app-based traffic sign recognition systems for your Android, which 
could bring the technology to older vehicles.
Any age group people can use this web - application to solve these issues easily.
